Env preset (http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env)
Babel preset that automatically determines the Babel plugins you need
based on your supported environments. Uses compat-table

`npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2017`
>npm WARN deprecated babel-preset-es2017@6.24.1: We're super �  excited
that you're trying to use ES2017 syntax, but instead of making more yearly presets � ,
 Babel now has a better preset that we recommend you use instead:
 npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev. preset-env without options will
compile ES2015+ down to ES5 just like using all the presets together
and thus is more future proof. It also allows you to target specific browsers
so that Babel can do less work and you can ship native ES2015+ to user � !
We are also in the process of releasing v7, so please give
http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0 a read and help test it out in beta!
